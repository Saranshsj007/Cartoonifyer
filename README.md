# Cartoonifyer
Carttoonifyer transforms images into its cartoon. Yes, now you can have a reason to tease your bestfriends saying, "YES, You look like a cartoon".
It is a python application that will transform an image into its cartoon using OpenCV. It imports the following modules:
*CV2: Imported to use OpenCV for image processing
*easygui: Imported to open a file box. It allows us to select any file from our system.
*Numpy: Images are stored and processed as numbers. These are taken as arrays. We use NumPy to deal with arrays.
*Imageio: Used to read the file which is chosen by file box using a path.
*Matplotlib: This library is used for visualization and plotting. Thus, it is imported to form the plot of images.
*OS: For OS interaction. Here, to read the path and save images to that path.
